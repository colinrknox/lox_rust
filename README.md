# lox_rust
Lox from Crafting Interpreters written in Rust

Usage: ```cargo run path/to/lox_file``` or ```cargo run``` for an interactive interpreter.

Currently, a work in progress as only the scanner is really implemented.

Also planning on integrating it as a part of my personal website using wasm.
